How Test Sets are generated:
Students are generated from a list of names. They are assigned a random unique student number and a focus which has 
a 60% chance of being CS and 40% chance of being DS. They are then assigned 10 difference preferences of projects
according to a Gaussian distribution i.e. some projects are more popular than others.
Projects are generated by staff members where each staff proposes an average of 3 projects. The number of staff members
depends on the number of students they are proposing the projects for i.e. 2 students : 1 staff member. The students choose
the projects according to the staff members focus area.

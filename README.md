TASK 2
We have created 3 classes to store the data called Project, StaffMember and Student. Project contains the title,
the staff member that proposed it and the stream it targets. Student contains general student info, their stream (focus),
and their project preferences. StaffMember consists of their name, research activities, research areas, their proposed projects
and whether or not they are special focus. We created the respective unit tests for each of these class aiming for high 
coverage. Each of the classes consists of fromCSV and fromCSVRow methods which reads data from disk and creates their objects.
These methods are tested in the unit test classes provided. Project offers a validate method which makes sures that the supervisors
that propose these projects are consistent with their focus.


TASK 1
How Test Sets are generated:
Students are generated from a list of names. They are assigned a random unique student number and a focus which has 
a 60% chance of being CS and 40% chance of being DS. They are then assigned 10 difference preferences of projects
according to a Gaussian distribution i.e. some projects are more popular than others.
Projects are generated by staff members where each staff proposes an average of 3 projects. The number of staff members
depends on the number of students they are proposing the projects for i.e. 2 students : 1 staff member. The students choose
the projects according to the staff members focus area.
